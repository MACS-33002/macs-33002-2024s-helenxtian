# Introduction to Machine Learning

Welcome to enroll in this class! We will use this course repo to organize assignments over the quarter. Specifically, for each assignment:
- you will first download it from Canvas
- and then complete it on your own computer
- and finally update it to this repo + submit the link of your updated assignment file on Canvas

By the end of this quarter, we hope this course repo to be an excellent showcase for your potential employers, demonstrating the breadth (the various models you've explored) and depth (model tuning, result analysis, and discussion) of your expertise in machine learning.

Please also feel free to customize this readme file with informative instruction/summary.
